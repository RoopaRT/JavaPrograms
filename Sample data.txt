The toString() method of the Object class returns the string representation of an object in Java. If we print any object, the Java Compiler internally invokes the toString() method on that object. The value returned by the toString() method is then printed.

Since toString() method is defined in Object class and all classes inherit from the Object class, toString() method can be invoked on objects of all classes.
