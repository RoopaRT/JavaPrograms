Inheritance

in Java multiple inheritance is not supported

constructors ,static and private methods and variables are not inherited.

super() keyword is used to call the super class constructor and it should be written in the first line of subclass constructor.

we can pass parameters in super() and it can call overloading constructors based on parameters in super().

super keyword is used to access immediate super class variables and methods.

this Keyword:-this keyword represents current oblect/instance.

this keywors is used to access non static member of current instance or class.


over ridiing:

Method can be overriden if they are inherited from parent class.

Here the method name,arguments and return type should be same as parent class.

In the subclass we cannot reduce the visibility in subclass but we can increse it for the following:

->public
protected
default
private

tostring() Method:-

The toString method is used to return a string representation of an object.
 If any object is printed, the toString() method is internally invoked by the java compiler.
 Else, the user implemented or overridden toString() method is called.



concrete method:-complete method with body

Abstraction:

The property by virtueof which only the essential details are displayed to the user non essential features are not displayed
 if we have one abstract method in one class then it is abstract class

abstract method:-incomplete method with no body andmethod ends with; and it must be declared with keyword abstract

abstract public void test(inta);

Abstract class: if we have one abstract method in one class then it is abstract class and the class  should have keyword abstract.
java considers abstract class as incomplete and obhect cannot be created.

we can create the child class of abstract class and we can override the abstract method by implementing the method.
